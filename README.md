For this example I used the site of the jovemnerd to be able to get the main subjects of nerdcasts.

First I went to the site and inspected the elements to get the page data.

![JovemNerd] (https://github.com/IgorVieira/crawlerPosts/blob/master/images/foto1.png?raw=true)
Second, I took the elements that contained the data and the url.

![JovemNerd] (https://github.com/IgorVieira/crawlerPosts/blob/master/images/foto2.png?raw=true)
Then I added them all to my data mining, and I saved all the data on the page to my database.
